## Windows Warning
A running antivirus on your PC may interfere with Savify.
To solve this please add an exception for Savify in your antivirus firewall.

## Spotify Authentication
Savify is a legitimate app that intergrates with **Spotify Api**, this means if you would like to convert an accepted Spotify link Savify will ask you to login with your Spotify account. This process uses [oAuth](https://oauth.net/) and is 100% secure. Savify respects the privacy of its users and only collects the necessary data to convert your song.
